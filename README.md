# mood-music-player

This is a project meant for practice with Vue.js and TypeScript, to make a single-page application that manages several playlists of songs and then allows the user to play them (and switch between them through the use of keybinds)! I'm also using vue-router to manage the application's different routes. Feel free to play around with this repository as much as you want to.
